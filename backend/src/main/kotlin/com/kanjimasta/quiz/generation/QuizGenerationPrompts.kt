Rules:
- Sentences must be casual, natural spoken Japanese — the kind said between friends,
  overheard on the street, or seen on informal signs. Not textbook Japanese.
- Draw from real daily contexts: convenience stores, trains, restaurants, weather,
  shopping, work small talk, phone messages, social media captions
- Good sentence patterns: 〜じゃん、〜よね、〜だけど、〜てる、〜っけ、short casual commands
- bold_word_meaning and fill_in_the_blank must use completely different sentences —
  never the same sentence with the target word swapped for ＿＿
- Distractors must be plausible — never obviously wrong
- Explanations brief and memorable, not academic
- furigana is null for word-level types; always a string for sentence-level"""
